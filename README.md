# SmallSat Avionics SIL/HIL Testbed

A bench testbed for small-satellite avionics: STM32 firmware, portable C++ flight logic, and Python tooling for software- and hardware-in-the-loop testing.
Everything runs on a workbench with real parts and test gear: an STM32 as the flight computer, sensors and power hardware, a logic analyzer, and a scope. Behavior gets checked in software first (SIL), then on the hardware itself (HIL), and the results - logs, reports, and scope captures - land in the repo alongside the code.

## The stack
- STM32 firmware in C: bare-metal CMSIS drivers, timers, UART, sensors, watchdog.
- Flight logic in C++: spacecraft modes, fault detection, and safe-mode handling, written to run and be tested on a PC before reaching hardware.
- Python: test scenarios, fault injection, and report generation.

## Roadmap
1. Bare-metal STM32: a heartbeat LED, a timer time base, then UART telemetry.
2. C++ mode and fault managers, with host unit tests.
3. First SIL demo: a scenario drops the bus voltage and the flight software enters SAFE, with a pass/fail report.
4. First HIL demo: the STM32 streams heartbeat packets over UART and the host detects a dropped link.

Later work adds real sensors (IMU, voltage/current, temperature), a watchdog reset demonstration, a FreeRTOS task model once the bare-metal side is stable, and a single-axis reaction wheel that points the platform to a commanded angle, run both against NASA's open-source 42 simulator and on the physical rig.

## Layout
- docs/ - architecture and setup notes
- firmware/ - the STM32 firmware
- hardware/ - bill of materials and bench notes

The C++, sim, and Python directories are added as those parts come together.
